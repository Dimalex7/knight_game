# Knight Game

My first platformer game built in Godot!  
You play as a knight who collects coins, avoids falling into gaps between moving platforms, and dodges roaming enemies.

## Features

- 2D platformer mechanics
- Moving platforms and enemies
- Coin collection and basic scoring system
- Simple but fun and challenging gameplay
